6  What is template literals in ES6 and how do you use them?
*/
Ans:-
Template literals, introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), are an enhanced way to work with strings in JavaScript. They provide a more convenient syntax for string interpolation, multiline strings, and expression embedding.

To use template literals in JavaScript, you wrap your string with backticks (`) instead of single or double quotes. Within the template literal, you can include placeholders using ${expression}. The expression inside the placeholder can be a variable, function call, or any valid JavaScript expression.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of template literals:

javascript

const name = 'Alice';
const age = 25;

const greeting = `Hello, my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;

console.log(greeting);
In this example, we create a template literal by enclosing the string with backticks. Inside the template literal, we use ${} to interpolate variables name and age into the resulting string. The output of the console.log statement will be:


Hello, my name is Alice and I am 25 years old.

Template literals also support multiline strings without the need for escape characters. You can simply add line breaks within the template literal:

javascript

const message = `
This is a
multiline
string.
`;

console.log(message);
In this case, the output will preserve the line breaks, resulting in:


This is a
multiline
string.

Template literals allow you to embed expressions directly within the string using ${}. This allows for dynamic values and calculations:

javascript

const a = 5;
const b = 7;

const result = `The sum of ${a} and ${b} is ${a + b}.`;

console.log(result);
The output will be:

The sum of 5 and 7 is 12.

Template literals provide a more expressive and flexible way to work with strings in JavaScript, making it easier to incorporate variables and expressions within the text. They improve code readability and simplify string manipulation.
