10 What is the purpose of the spread operator (...) in ES6?
*/
Ans:-
The spread operator (...) is a powerful feature introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) that allows you to expand or spread iterable objects, such as arrays or strings, into individual elements. It has multiple purposes and can be used in different contexts.

Array Manipulation and Concatenation:
The spread operator can be used to create new arrays by combining or manipulating existing arrays. It allows you to easily concatenate arrays or create shallow copies. Here are a few examples:

javascript

const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [4, 5, 6];

const combinedArray = [...arr1, ...arr2];
console.log(combinedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

const shallowCopy = [...arr1];
console.log(shallowCopy); // Output: [1, 2, 3]

In this example, the spread operator is used to concatenate arr1 and arr2 into combinedArray. It is also used to create a shallow copy of arr1 in shallowCopy.

Function Arguments:
The spread operator can be used to pass multiple arguments to a function, even when the arguments are contained in an array. It expands the elements of the array into individual arguments. Here's an example:

javascript

function sum(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c;
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const result = sum(...numbers);
console.log(result); // Output: 6

In this example, the spread operator is used to pass the elements of the numbers array as individual arguments to the sum() function.

Object Manipulation (ES9 and later):
Starting from ECMAScript 2018 (ES9), the spread operator can also be used to copy or merge objects. It creates a new object by spreading the properties of an existing object. Here's an example:

javascript

const obj1 = { x: 1, y: 2 };
const obj2 = { z: 3 };

const mergedObject = { ...obj1, ...obj2 };
console.log(mergedObject); // Output: { x: 1, y: 2, z: 3 }

In this example, the spread operator is used to create mergedObject by spreading the properties of obj1 and obj2 into a new object.

String to Array Conversion:
The spread operator can be used to convert a string into an array of characters. Each character becomes an individual element in the resulting array. Here's an example:

javascript

const str = 'Hello';
const chars = [...str];
console.log(chars); // Output: ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']

In this example, the spread operator is used to convert the string str into an array of characters.

These are just a few use cases of the spread operator. It provides a concise and convenient way to work with iterable objects and enables efficient array manipulation, function invocation, object merging, and string manipulation in JavaScript.
